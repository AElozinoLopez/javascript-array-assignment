    <h2>ARRAY EXERCISES</h2>

    <P>
        1. Write a function called extractKey which accepts two parameters, an array of objects, and the name of a key and returns an array with just the values for that key.

        extractKey([{name: "Elie", isInstructor:true},{name: "Tim", isInstructor:true},{name: "Matt", isInstructor:true}], "name"); // ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"]
    </P>

    <p>
        2. Write a function called filterLetters which accepts an array of letters and returns the number of occurrences of a specific letter. This function should be case insensitive

        filterLetters(["a","a","b","c","A"], "a"); // 3
        filterLetters(["a","a","b","c","A"], "z"); // 0
        filterLetters(["a","a","b","c","A"], "B"); // 1
    </p>

    <p>
        3. Write a function called printFirstAndLast which accepts an array (of objects) and console.logs a new string with the first character and the last character of each value.
        printFirstAndLast(['awesome','example','of','forEach'])

        // ae   
        // ee
        // of
        // fh

    </p>

    <p>
       4. Write a function called valTimesIndex which accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array with each value multiplied by the index it is at in the array: 
        valTimesIndex([1,2,3]) // [0,2,6]
        valTimesIndex([5,10,15]) // [0,10,30]
    </p>

    <p>
        5. Write a function called addKeyAndValue which accepts three parameters, an array (of objects), a key and a value. 
        This function should return the array of objects after each key and value has been added. You can do this a few 
        ways, either by reducing starting with an empty array and making copies of the object or by starting with the 
        actual array!
        addKeyAndValue([{name:'Joshua'},{name:'Mark'},{name:'Arthur'}],"isInstructor", true);
